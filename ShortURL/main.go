This is the entry point for the API, the purpose of the API is to shorten url links via a REST HTTP request
Once the code is built and running, to create a short url to a long url mapping, send a POST request to http://localhost:5100/Create, the POST request should include the shortUrl and the longUrl as follows:
{'shorturl':'cosmosfading','longurl':'https://cosmosmagazine.com/space/universe-slowly-fading-away'}

You could then consume a shorturl by issuing a GET request to http://localhost:5100/<the short url>
The program makes use of the gorilla mux library for routing as well as the mgo library to interface with mongo database
